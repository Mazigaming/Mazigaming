# Hey, I'm Mazi 👋

**Computer Science Student | Full Stack | Systems Programmer**

I'm passionate about many thing but lately i've taken an intrest in low-level systems, compilers, and reverse engineering. Currently focused on building **GaiaRusted** — a production-grade Rust compiler for x86-64 architectures.
